# SOLID principles
## Single Responsibility Principle
- Every class must have a single responsibility.
- Classes that has more than one job should be separated to different classes.

## Open Closed Principle
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Classes must be generic enough to handle the extensive progression of the application
- However, this progression must not require a modification of functions.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
- A subclass should be able to substitute its superclass without any complication
in order to be a subclass.

##Interface Segregation Principle
- The dependency of classes should be on the smallest inteface possible.
- Rather than having one interface for multiple functionalities, 
there should be smaller segregated interfaces.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
- Depending on abstraction/ interfaces rather than concrete classes
